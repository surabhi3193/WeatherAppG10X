1.  A search bar to enter a location.

2.  Upon entering a location and pressing the search button, the app will fetch weather data for that location from a weather API ( OpenWeatherMap).

3.  It'll display the weather information, including the temperature, humidity and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

4.  It'll handle error cases, such as when the API request fails or when the entered location is not found.

5.  Used RecyclerView to display a list of hourly or daily weather forecasts.

6.  Implemented basic caching mechanism to store the previously fetched weather data and display it offline.

The app is structured by using MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and demonstrate the use of Kotlin, Retrofit, JSON parsing, RecyclerView, and error handling.
